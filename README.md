    Particle Auth Web3Modal V3 Demo
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Demo application showcasing the utilization of a custom Particle Auth connector (`ParticleWalletConnector`) with Web3Modal V3, facilitating connection through social logins. This does not use Particle Auth Core currently, the more modern version of Particle Auth, although `ParticleWalletConnector` is quite malleable. 

Built using **Particle Auth**, **TypeScript**, **Web3Modal**

## üîë Particle Auth
Particle Auth, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc.
